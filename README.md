# üí´ About Me:
Hi there, I'm Anand Prakash Dwivedi! I am a third-year graduate student at the Army Institute of Technology, pursuing my degree in computer engineering. Recently, I got selected as a technical analyst intern at Deutsche Bank, where I'm excited to learn more about the financial sector and gain hands-on experience in developing financial applications.¬†I have a passion for coding and particularly enjoy working with React and Node. I find it thrilling to create responsive and dynamic user interfaces using React. Currently, I am focusing on learning more about Node and Express and how to build scalable backend systems for web applications.¬†In addition to my technical skills, I am also an avid learner and enjoy exploring new technologies and concepts related to software development. During my free time, you can find me reading about new programming languages or working on personal coding projects. I am always open to new opportunities for collaboration and growth, so feel free to connect with me on Github or LinkedIn. I would be happy to discuss any ideas or projects that we could work on together!
